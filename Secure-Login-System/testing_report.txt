Duplicate registration was prevented.

Status: PASS

--------------------------------------------------

3.3 Password Hashing
Test Description:
Verify that passwords are not stored in plaintext in the database.

Login using correct email and password.

Expected Result:
User should be authenticated and redirected to the appropriate dashboard.

Actual Result:
Login successful and dashboard loaded.

Status: PASS

--------------------------------------------------

3.5 User Login (Invalid Credentials)
Test Description:
Login using incorrect password.

Expected Result:
System should deny access and display an error message.

Actual Result:
Access denied and error message displayed.

Status: PASS

--------------------------------------------------

3.6 Login CAPTCHA Validation
Test Description:
Attempt to login with an incorrect CAPTCHA answer.

Expected Result:
Login should fail and display CAPTCHA error.

Actual Result:
CAPTCHA validation failed and user was not logged in.

Status: PASS

--------------------------------------------------

3.7 Login CAPTCHA (Correct Answer)
Test Description:
Login with correct credentials and correct CAPTCHA.

Expected Result:
Login should be successful.

Actual Result:
User logged in successfully.

Status: PASS

--------------------------------------------------

3.8 Account Lockout
Test Description:
Attempt login with wrong password three times.

Expected Result:
Account should be locked after three failed attempts.

Status: PASS

--------------------------------------------------
4. SECURITY TESTING
--------------------------------------------------
The following security mechanisms were verified:

- Password hashing using bcrypt
- CAPTCHA to prevent automated login attempts
- Account lockout to mitigate brute-force attacks
- SQL injection prevention using SQLAlchemy ORM
- Role-based access control enforcement
- Session handling to prevent unauthorized access

All mechanisms performed as expected.

--------------------------------------------------
5. CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------
The Secure Login System was tested thoroughly and all major features and security
controls functioned correctly. The application meets the project requirements
and demonstrates secure software development practices.

The system is considered stable and ready for final submission.
